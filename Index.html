            <h2>Who is this god in human's skin?</h2>
            <p>That hidden hero, the one who no one knows saves the day</p>
            <p>How do you do it?</p>
            <p>Carry the weight of a lot of things?</p>
            <p>Amidst everything, you are steadily there.</p>

            <h2>No, not you</h2>
            <p>I'm not talking to you. You who brings tears to my eyes</p>
            <p>You who would walk at any given chance</p>
            <p>You that steadily hits my mother and leaves her to fend for us</p>
            <p>The reason why I'm scared of getting married</p>
            <p>You are <b>not a father</b></p>
            <p>At least, not in the sense of it</p>
            <p>Is it harsh to say i wish you were dead than this?</p>
            <p>Well, you're dead to I and my siblings</p>

            <p>Today is your day but there's a sore taste left in my mouth and a tears threatening to spill</p>
            <p>You are not here with me is why</p>
            <p>Something I am sure you'd have avoided if you could</p>
            <p>Why do i feel this way?</p>
            <p>I heard stories of how you did beautiful things</p>
            <p>Not to worry, we are fine and would be as God does not forget his own</p>

            <p>We cannot forget you</p>
            <p>You are very important</p>
            <p>In my opinion, the most important</p>
            <p>You have to be what you enjoyed while rejecting those you hated yours showed while growing up</p>
            <p>If you kmow you would not be hands up, please do not bother bringing damaged/ hurt individuls into this world</p>
            <p>If you know your temper cannot be controlled, abort mission</p>
            <p>If you cannot till the ground, leave it for the capable ones</p>
            <p>We are not for our mothers so stop making us our mothers children</p>
            <p>We hope you are kept and do not leave us and our mother's stranded</p>
            <p>You would not be perfect but be wonderful even with all your flaws</p>
